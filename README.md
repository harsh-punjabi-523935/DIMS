# Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS)

## Overview
The Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS) is a blockchain-based solution that allows individuals to have full control over their identity data. This system allows corporates to request access to individual data, while individuals can grant or revoke access in a transparent and secure manner. The data is stored on the Ethereum blockchain and sensitive documents are stored on IPFS.

## Features
- User registration and profile management.
- Corporates can request access to individual data.
- Individuals can grant or revoke access to their data.
- Data stored securely on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Sensitive documents stored on IPFS.
- Permission-based access to identity data.

## Technologies Used
- **Ethereum** (Smart Contracts, Solidity)
- **IPFS** (Decentralized storage)
- **React.js** (Frontend)
- **Web3.js** (Blockchain interaction)
- **MetaMask** (Authentication and interaction with Ethereum)
- **Solidity** (Smart Contracts)

## Requirements
Before running this project, ensure the following are installed:
